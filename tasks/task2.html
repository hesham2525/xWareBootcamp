<!-- Salah started his senior career in 2010 playing for Al Mokawloon, departing in 2012 to join Basel,
               where he won two Swiss Super League titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11 million,
                but limited gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina and Roma,
                who later signed him permanently for €15 million. In the 2016-17 season,
                Salah was a key figure in Roma's unsuccessful title bid, 
               reaching double figures in both goals and assists.[18] In 2017,
                Salah signed for Liverpool for a then-club record transfer of £36.9 million. 
                In his first season, he set the record for most Premier League goals scored (32) in a 38-game season and helped Liverpool to the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final. -->
